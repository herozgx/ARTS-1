Algorithm、Review、Technique、Share 简称 ARTS

每周至少做一个leetcode 的算法题，阅读并点评至少一篇英文技术文章，学习至少一个技术技巧，至少分享一篇有观点和思考的技术文章。坚持至少一年！（也就是：Algorithm、Review、Technique、Share 简称ARTS）


With regarding to the ARTS, it's the personal object we need do it weekly, nobody will reminder you and check it, This is not the junior school. The self-motivation and self-management are the keys for everyone. And I encourage you share the ARTS to the group. then other people can give you feedback, this would let you learn more and more , can grow up quickly (The Tips and Share should be practical or useful, it's better can reflect your job). Do not be shy, otherwise it's meaningless to join this group.
